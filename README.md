# HARDWARIO Cloud Fetch

This repository contains a Python 3 CLI script to fetch device messages in HARDWARIO Cloud and extract useful measurements from it. The measurements are written to the specified XLSX file. It is not distributed via PyPI as code modification by customers is expected, and simplicity is the goal.


## Requirements

* Python 3


## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

       git clone git@github.com:hardwario/cloud-fetch.git

1. Install the Python dependencies:

1. Run the script:

       python3 fetch.py -g GROUP_ID -t GROUP_TOKEN
